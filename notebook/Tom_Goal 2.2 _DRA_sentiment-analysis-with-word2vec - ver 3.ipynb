    "### 1️⃣ **Data Loading** 📂\n",
    "- 📥 Loads a WebMD dataset with drug reviews\n",
    "- 🎯 Uses **\"Reviews\"** column as input text and **\"Satisfaction\"** column as target\n",
    "- 🧹 Cleans the data and splits it into training/testing sets\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ **Word2Vec Training (Model 1)** 🤖\n",
    "- 🏋️ Trains your own Word2Vec model on the review text\n",
    "- 🔢 Converts words into numerical vectors that capture word meanings\n",
    "- 📐 Creates embeddings with **60 dimensions** per word\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ **Transfer Learning (Model 2)** 🚀\n",
    "- ⬇️ Loads pre-trained model: **\"glove-wiki-gigaword-50\"**\n",
    "- 🌐 Model trained on Wikipedia with superior word representations\n",
    "- 📚 Like using a dictionary that already knows word relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ **Text Processing** ⚙️\n",
    "- 🔗 Converts review sentences into sequences of word vectors\n",
    "- 📏 Pads sequences to uniform length (**200 words max**)\n",
    "- 🎛️ Prepares data for the neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ **Neural Network Training** 🧠\n",
    "- 🏗️ Builds an **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) model\n",
    "- 📝 LSTM excels at understanding text sequences\n",
    "- 🎓 Trains model to predict satisfaction from review text\n",
    "- ⏹️ Uses early stopping to prevent overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6️⃣ **Evaluation** 📈\n",
