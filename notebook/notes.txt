After you do docker run, it returns a URL for the uvicorn server running the API,
so you can use it to see if the container and API is working. Note that you need to build the docker image
specifically for production by specifying the region. Create a Makefile that provides aliases for
Terminal commands. Do Direnv reload after changing environment variables and use environment variables
in you Terminal commands.
